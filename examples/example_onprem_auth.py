"""
On-Prem Authentication Example

This example demonstrates the authentication process for an on-prem Cribl
instance using username and password credentials.

1. Authenticate with your username and password to obtain a Bearer token.
2. Create an SDK client that uses the Bearer token for API calls.
3. Validate the connection by checking the server health status and listing 
all git branches.

Prerequisites: Replace the placeholder values for ONPREM_SERVER_URL 
ONPREM_USERNAME, and ONPREM_PASSWORD with your server URL and credentials. 
Your credentials are sensitive information and should be kept private. 

NOTE: This example is for on-prem deployments only. It does not require .env 
file configuration.
